Predictive Modeling of Healthcare Acquired Infections Using MIMIC-IV ICU Data
Objective: Develop and compare predictive models for five HAIs types (CLABSI, MRSA, CAUTI, VAP, SSI). Evaluate patient level variables (age, gender, LOS, admission-types). Address class imbalance using resampling techniques. 
Methods: Select target HAI, load filtered dataset into WEKA, apply resampling to address imbalance, train multiple models, compare performance.
